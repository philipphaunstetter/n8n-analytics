# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product name: Elova - Automation Workflow Observability (provider-agnostic)

Summary
- Build a provider-agnostic web application that gives users visibility into their automation workflows: overview of running workflows, flowchart visualization, execution status, endpoint uptime checks, and instance health. 
- MVP focuses on n8n (self-hosted or cloud) while designing an adapter pattern to support additional platforms later (Zapier, Make.com).

1. Problem Statement
Teams running automations across tools lack a single, actionable view to monitor reliability, debug failures, and understand performance. Each platform exposes partial data with differing models. Users need one place to see workflow health, investigate issues, and confirm endpoints and instances are healthy.

2. Goals (Objectives)
- Provide a unified, easy-to-understand view of automation health across providers.
- Reduce time to detect and resolve failed runs (MTTD/MTTR).
- Offer drill-down from aggregate metrics to per-execution detail.
- Visualize workflow structure (flowchart) to understand where issues occur.
- Check external endpoints and platform instance health from the same UI.

3. Non-Goals (for MVP)
- Full workflow editing/authoring or deployment.
- General-purpose BI/ELT data warehousing.
- Multi-tenant organization/RBAC beyond basic access control.
- Complex alerting/notifications (stretch for post-MVP).

4. Target Users and Personas

**Primary (MVP Focus):**
- **Automation Ops Engineer** (self-hosted n8n or mixed stack): Maintains critical automations; needs reliability monitoring, quick failure triage, and visual debugging through flowcharts.
- **Maker/Developer** (project owner, smaller teams): Owns several workflows; wants quick insight, step-level debugging, and performance tracking without enterprise complexity.

**Secondary (Post-MVP):**
- **Team Lead/Stakeholder**: Monitors uptime, success rate, SLA adherence, and needs executive dashboard views.
- **Multi-Platform Teams**: Users running n8n + Zapier + Make who need unified observability.

**User Type Adaptability** (inspired by competitive analysis):
- **Developer Mode**: Console-style logs, JSON viewers, technical details (Pipedream pattern)
- **Operations Mode**: Timeline views, incident correlation, audit trails (Tines pattern)
- **Executive Mode**: Summary cards, trend indicators, governance dashboards (Workato/Tray pattern)

5. Key Use Cases and User Journeys
- Monitor health: View success rate, failures, durations across time; filter by provider, workflow, status, time range.
- Debug failures: Find failed executions; inspect metadata and errors; identify problematic step/node in the flowchart.
- Validate endpoints: Periodically check key HTTP endpoints that workflows depend on; see uptime/latency.
- Instance health: Confirm platform instance connectivity and status (e.g., n8n self-hosted), including auth validity and version info.

6. Scope
6.1 MVP
- One provider adapter (n8n) behind a provider-agnostic domain model.
- Dashboard: Total executions, success rate, failed executions for a selectable time range.
- Executions: List/filter by status, workflow, time range; open execution details.
- Workflows: List workflows; show per-workflow stats snapshot; open flowchart view.
- Flowchart Viewer: Render workflow graph; highlight failed step if available from the provider.
- Endpoint Monitoring: Configure a small set of HTTP endpoint checks; record status/latency; display uptime summary.
- Instance Status: Connectivity check, auth validity, basic metadata (version, latency) for the active provider instance.
- Settings: Configure provider connection(s) securely; manage endpoint checks.
- Demo Mode: Support a demo dataset or read-only demo connection (e.g., n8n-demo) to explore features without real credentials.

6.2 Post-MVP (Future)

- Export capabilities (PNG, PDF) for documentation and incident reports.

7.6 Endpoint Monitoring
- Configuration: Add endpoints (name, URL, method, headers, interval, timeout, expected status range).
- Checks: Perform periodic HTTP requests from the server; store recent results in memory or lightweight storage.
- Display: Uptime percentage over selected period, last latency, last error reason.
- Manual recheck button.

7.7 Instance Status
- Connection probe to active provider instance (e.g., n8n base URL).
- Show version (if provided by API), auth validity, and round-trip latency.
- Basic guidance if misconfigured.

7.8 Settings
- Provider connections: Securely store credentials (server-only environment or secret store).
- Endpoint monitors: Create, edit, delete checks; enable/disable.
- Demo mode: Toggle to use demo data or demo instance if available.

8. Data Model (Provider-Agnostic)
- Provider: { id, type: "n8n" | "zapier" | "make", displayName }
- Workflow: { id, providerId, name, active, createdAt?, updatedAt? }
- Execution: { id, providerId, workflowId, status: success|failed|error|canceled|running|waiting, startedAt, stoppedAt?, durationMs?, errorMessage? }
- Graph: { nodes: [{ id, label, type, meta }], edges: [{ from, to, label?, meta }] }
- EndpointCheck: { id, name, url, method, headers?, intervalSec, timeoutMs, expectedStatus: [min,max] }
- EndpointResult: { checkId, timestamp, statusCode, latencyMs, ok, error? }

9. Integration Notes (Initial: n8n)
- API base: configurable (N8N_HOST). Auth via API key (X-N8N-API-KEY).
- Endpoints typically used: /api/v1/executions, /api/v1/workflows, and any available workflow read/graph endpoint.
- Map provider fields to domain model. Use server-side proxy routes to avoid exposing secrets to the browser.
- Zapier/Make (future): Define connectors that map their data structures (Zaps/Steps; Scenarios/Modules) into the same domain shape.

10. Non-Functional Requirements
- Security: Secrets never sent to the browser; stored server-side. Do not log secrets.
- Privacy: No telemetry by default; if enabled, aggregate only non-sensitive usage metrics with opt-out.
- Performance: Initial dashboard load under 2s with typical data; table pagination for large result sets.
- Reliability: Endpoint checks resilient to transient failures; backoff and timeouts.
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation and basic ARIA for tables, dialogs, and the flowchart viewer.
- Browser support: Latest two versions of major browsers.

11. Telemetry and Analytics (Optional, opt-in)
- Track feature usage (view dashboard, open execution, render flowchart, add endpoint check) without storing sensitive payloads.
- Error tracking on the client and server with PII safe-guards.

12. Risks and Mitigations
- CORS and secret exposure: Always proxy provider API via server; never call with API key from client.
- Provider API variability: Encapsulate in adapters; version guard and capability flags.
- Data completeness: Some providers may not expose detailed node-level errors; surface gracefully.
- Rate limits: Respect provider limits; use pagination and intervals; document constraints.

13. Release Plan
- v0.1 (MVP): n8n adapter, Dashboard counters, Executions list+detail, Workflows list, Flowchart viewer (basic), Endpoint checks (basic), Instance status, Settings, Demo mode.
- v0.2 (Beta): Trend charts, duration percentiles, workflow detail metrics, improved flowchart annotations, CSV export.
- v1.0: Alerting, saved views, multi-provider support (Zapier, Make), improved a11y, team features.

14. Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
- With valid provider credentials, dashboard counters match provider data for selected time ranges.
- Executions page filters work; opening a failed execution shows error synopsis.
- Flowchart viewer renders and can highlight a failed node when data is available.
- Endpoint monitors can be created, run, and display uptime/latency summaries.
- Instance status shows connectivity and basic metadata; misconfiguration surfaces clear guidance.
- No provider secrets are exposed in client requests or logs.
