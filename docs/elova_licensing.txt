## Key n8n-Inspired Differentiators

Based on n8n's successful model, here are the strategic additions:

### 1. **Shared Projects** (New Feature)
**Inspired by:** n8n's shared projects (3 on Pro, unlimited on Enterprise)

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Community**: No shared projects (solo use only)
- **Pro**: 3 shared projects (small team collaboration)
- **Business**: 10 shared projects (agency/client separation)
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited shared projects

**Why It Works:** Creates natural collaboration boundaries that drive upgrades. Teams hit the 3-project limit quickly when managing multiple clients or departments.

### 2. **Workflow History & Versioning** (Enhanced)
**Inspired by:** n8n's workflow history feature (Pro+)

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Community**: No version history (current state only)
- **Pro**: 30-day workflow configuration history
- **Business**: 90-day workflow history + Git integration
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited history + full version control

**Why It Works:** Critical for debugging and compliance. Teams can't confidently make changes without rollback capability.

### 3. **Environment Variables & Webhook Auth** (New)
**Inspired by:** n8n's Pro-tier security features

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Community**: No environment variables support
- **Pro**: Environment variables + webhook authentication
- **Business**: Multiple environment sets (dev/stage/prod)
- **Enterprise**: Full secrets management + external vault integration

**Why It Works:** Production teams need proper secret management. This is a clear "can't go to production without it" feature.

### 4. **Queue Mode & Scaling** (New Infrastructure Feature)
**Inspired by:** n8n's queue mode for horizontal scaling

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Community**: Single-process execution only
- **Pro**: Queue mode enabled (horizontal scaling support)
- **Business**: Queue mode + load balancing guidance
- **Enterprise**: Full HA setup + dedicated scaling support

**Why It Works:** As monitoring load grows, single-process becomes a bottleneck. Queue mode is the bridge to production-scale.

### 5. **Execution Search Capabilities** (Enhanced)
**Inspired by:** n8n's advanced execution search

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Community**: Basic filtering only (status, workflow, date)
- **Pro**: Advanced search with execution metadata
- **Business**: Full-text search across error messages
- **Enterprise**: Custom search queries + saved searches

**Why It Works:** Finding specific failed executions becomes impossible with thousands of runs. Search is a "must-have" for operations teams.

### 6. **License Ping & Telemetry** (Implementation Detail)
**Inspired by:** n8n's daily license validation approach

**Implementation for Elova:**
- Daily license key validation ping
- Tracks: instance count, execution volume, feature usage
- 7-day grace period if ping fails (network issues)
- Telemetry opt-out available (anonymized by default)
- Offline mode for Enterprise (signed license tokens)

**Why It Works:** Prevents abuse while being reasonable about temporary connectivity issues. Enterprise gets offline option for air-gapped environments.

### 7. **Overage Handling** (Pricing Flexibility)
**Inspired by:** n8n's approach to quota overages

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Soft Limits:** Workflows continue running when limits hit
- **Warning System:** Email alerts at 80%, 90%, 100% of limits
- **Grace Period:** 14 days to upgrade before enforcement
- **Overage Pricing:** 
  - Pro: $10/additional instance
  - Business: $200/additional 25 instances
  - Enterprise: Custom pricing

**Why It Works:** Avoids sudden service disruption, creates upgrade conversations naturally, maintains goodwill.

### 8. **Startup Program** (New Initiative)
**Inspired by:** n8n's 50% discount for qualifying startups

**Implementation for Elova:**
- **Eligibility:** Companies with <20 employees, <$5M raised
- **Benefit:** Business plan at Pro pricing ($39/mo = 80% off)
- **Duration:** 12 months, then full Business pricing
- **Application:** Simple form + proof (company website, funding info)

**Why It Works:** Builds brand loyalty early, converts startups into enterprise customers later, creates word-of-mouth marketing.

### Community (Free)
**Target:** Solo developers, hobbyists, evaluation users  
**Monthly Price:** $0  
**Annual Price:** $0  
**Conversion Goal:** 10-15% upgrade to Pro within 6 months

### Pro
**Target:** Small teams (2-10 people), startups, power users  
**Monthly Price:** $39/month  
**Annual Price:** $390/year (save $78 = ~17% discount)  
**Value Proposition:** "Everything you need for production monitoring"

### Business
**Target:** Agencies, consultancies, mid-market companies  
**Monthly Price:** $199/month  
**Annual Price:** $1,990/year (save $398 = ~17% discount)  
**Value Proposition:** "Professional client management with white-labeling"

### Enterprise
**Target:** Large organizations, compliance-heavy industries  
**Monthly Price:** Starting at $500/month (custom pricing)  
**Annual Price:** Custom (typically $5,000-20,000+/year)  
**Value Proposition:** "Multi-provider visibility with enterprise security"

## Add-On Pricing (Optional Revenue Streams)

| Add-On | Pro | Business | Enterprise | Price |
|--------|-----|----------|------------|-------|
| Additional Instance (beyond tier limit) | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | $10/instance/month |
| Extended Retention (+30 days) | ✅ | ✅ | Included | $25/month |
| Additional Team Member (beyond limit) | ✅ | ✅ | Included | $8/user/month |
| Additional Shared Project | ✅ | ✅ | Included | $15/project/month |
| Additional Workspace | N/A | ✅ | Included | $50/workspace/month |
| SMS Alerting (per month) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | $15/month (100 SMS) |
| Priority Support Upgrade | ✅ | ✅ | Included | $99/month |

### 🆕 Overage Pricing (n8n-Inspired Flexibility)

**Philosophy:** Don't interrupt workflows when users hit limits. Provide grace period and automatic overage billing.

**How It Works:**
1. User hits their instance limit (e.g., 5 on Pro tier)
2. System sends email notification: "You're at 80% of your instance limit"
3. User can continue adding instances beyond limit
4. Workflows keep running without interruption
5. After 14-day grace period, automatic overage charges apply
6. Alternative: Upgrade to next tier anytime with prorated credit

**Overage Rates:**
- **Pro Tier**: $10/additional instance (charged monthly)
- **Business Tier**: $200/bucket of 25 additional instances
- **No overages on Community** - hard limit enforced (encourages upgrades)

**Example Scenario:**
- User on Pro plan (5 instances included)
- Adds 6th and 7th instances in month 3
- Receives notification: "You have 2 instances over your limit ($20/month)"
- Options presented:
  - Pay $20/month overage
  - Upgrade to Business (50 instances) for $199/month
  - Remove 2 instances to stay within limit

## License Enforcement & Technical Implementation

### License Key Format
```
ELOVA-[TIER]-[RANDOM]-[CHECKSUM]
Example: ELOVA-PRO-X7K9M2P5Q8-A3F7
```

### Validation Strategy
**Online Validation (Recommended):**
- License key validated against central license server

### Grace Periods & User Experience
**License Expiration:**
- 30 days before: Email reminder with renewal link
- 14 days before: In-app notification banner
- 7 days before: Daily email reminder
- 0 days (expired): Read-only mode - can view data, cannot add new instances
- 14 days after: Data export available, some features locked
- 30 days after: Full lockdown (only dashboard view)

**License Upgrades:**
- Instant: New tier features activate immediately
- Prorated: Credit unused time toward upgrade
- Downgrade: Scheduled for next billing cycle with warnings about data retention

### Feature Gating Implementation
```javascript
// Example feature check
if (license.tier === 'COMMUNITY' && instanceCount >= 1) {
  throw new Error('Community license limited to 1 instance. Upgrade to Pro for 5 instances.');
}

if (license.tier !== 'PRO' && license.tier !== 'BUSINESS' && license.tier !== 'ENTERPRISE') {
  // Block Cron Job Management access
  throw new Error('Cron Job Management requires Pro license or higher.');
}

if (license.dataRetentionDays && executionAge > license.dataRetentionDays) {
  // Automatic cleanup based on tier
  deleteExecution(executionId);
}
```

## Questions for Finalization

1. **License Validation:** Do you prefer online (phone-home) or offline (signed token) validation? Or both?
   - **Recommendation:** Online by default (like n8n), offline option for Enterprise only

2. **Payment Integration:** Stripe, Paddle, or another payment processor?
   - **Recommendation:** Stripe (simplest) or Paddle (handles VAT/taxes globally)

3. **Enterprise Sales:** Will you handle Enterprise sales directly or need a sales team?
   - **Recommendation:** Start with direct sales (Calendly + custom proposals), hire sales rep at 5+ Enterprise customers

4. **Beta Pricing:** Should early adopters get lifetime discounts?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes - first 100 customers get 30% lifetime discount on Pro/Business

5. **Free Trial:** How long should Pro/Business trial period be?
   - **Recommendation:** 14 days (industry standard, matches n8n)

6. **Non-Commercial Restrictions:** Should Community license restrict commercial use, or allow it?
   - **Recommendation:** Allow commercial use (like n8n) - more user-friendly, creates goodwill

7. **🆕 Startup Program:** Should we launch with the startup discount program immediately?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes - low risk, high marketing value, builds early adopter community

8. **🆕 Overage Approach:** Should we use soft limits (n8n style) or hard limits?
   - **Recommendation:** Soft limits for paid tiers, hard limits for Community only

9. **🆕 Shared Projects:** How should project isolation work technically?
   - **Recommendation:** Database-level isolation with per-project access control lists

10. **🆕 Git Integration:** Which Git providers should Business tier support?
    - **Recommendation:** Start with GitHub + GitLab, add Bitbucket post-MVP

- Explain why our model is simpler (no per-step costs)
- Comparison calculator vs. APM tools (Datadog, New Relic)
- Clear FAQ: "What happens when I hit limits?"

### 3. **Developer-First Onboarding**
Like n8n's 14-day trial approach:
- No credit card for Pro trial
