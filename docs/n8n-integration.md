# n8n API Integration Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented real-time data retrieval from the n8n test instance for Elova's dashboard analytics. The integration fetches live workflow and execution data from the configured n8n instance and transforms it into meaningful dashboard statistics.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Configuration

The integration uses environment variables from `.env.local`:

```env
N8N_HOST="https://n8n.***REMOVED***/"
N8N_API_KEY="***REMOVED***..."
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE="false"
```

### 2. API Integration

#### Dashboard Stats Endpoint (`/api/dashboard/stats`)

**Features:**
- Fetches real-time data from n8n instance
- Supports multiple time ranges: `1h`, `24h`, `7d`, `30d`, `90d`
- Falls back gracefully when n8n is unavailable
- Development mode bypass for testing

**Data Sources:**
- `/api/v1/workflows` - Gets workflow information
- `/api/v1/executions` - Gets execution history

**Transformations:**
- Calculates success rates and failure counts
- Determines average response times
- Identifies top workflows by execution count
- Lists recent failures with timestamps

### 3. Real Data Examples

**24-hour stats from test instance:**
```json
{
  "timeRange": "24h",
  "totalExecutions": 8,
  "successfulExecutions": 8,
  "failedExecutions": 0,
  "successRate": 100,
  "avgResponseTime": 11497,
  "topWorkflows": [
    {
      "workflowId": "IFVZ44LSAgW0uhSS",
      "name": "Lead",
      "executions": 6,
      "successes": 6,
      "successRate": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

**7-day stats showing real production activity:**
```json
{
  "timeRange": "7d",
  "totalExecutions": 100,
  "successfulExecutions": 64,
  "failedExecutions": 36,
  "successRate": 64,
  "avgResponseTime": 15397,
  "topWorkflows": [
    {
      "workflowId": "IFVZ44LSAgW0uhSS",
      "name": "Lead",
      "executions": 90,
      "successes": 54,
      "successRate": 60
    }
  ],
  "recentFailures": [
    {
      "executionId": "348",
      "workflowName": "Lead",
      "error": "Execution failed",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-10T05:44:48.209Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## API Client Implementation

### Enhanced n8n API Client (`src/lib/n8n-api.ts`)

**Capabilities:**
- Proper authentication using X-N8N-API-KEY header
- Support for workflow and execution endpoints
- Error handling and response validation
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

### Dashboard Integration

The dashboard stats function (`fetchN8nDashboardStats`) performs:

1. **Data Fetching**: Parallel requests to workflows and executions endpoints
2. **Time Filtering**: Filters executions by selected time range
3. **Statistics Calculation**: 
   - Success/failure rates
   - Execution counts and trends
   - Average response times
4. **Data Transformation**: Converts n8n data format to our dashboard schema

## Deployment Modes

### Development Mode
- Demo mode can be toggled with `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE`
- Development authentication bypass for testing
- Console logging for debugging

### Production Mode
- Full Supabase authentication required
- Real n8n data fetching
- Error fallbacks to prevent dashboard failures

## Verified Test Instance Data

**Connected to:** `https://n8n.***REMOVED***/`

**Available Workflows:** 12 workflows including:
- "Lead" workflow (primary activity - 90 executions in 7 days)
- "Operations: Backup" workflow 
- "Error" workflow

**Execution History:** 100+ executions with real success/failure data

## Feature Flags

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEMO_MODE`: Toggle between demo data and real n8n data
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_AUTH`: Enable development authentication bypass

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback when n8n instance is unavailable
- Empty stats returned if API credentials are missing
- Console logging for debugging and monitoring
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

## Performance Considerations

- Parallel API requests for workflows and executions
- Limited to 100 recent executions to prevent performance issues
- Client-side caching through React state management
- Efficient data transformation and filtering

## Future Enhancements

1. **Detailed Error Messages**: Fetch specific execution error details
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
3. **Historical Trends**: Time-series data for charts
4. **Workflow Performance**: Individual workflow analytics
5. **Alert System**: Notification for execution failures

## Testing

The integration has been tested with:
- ✅ Multiple time ranges (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
- ✅ Real production data from test instance
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks
- ✅ Build and deployment process
- ✅ Type safety and compilation

## API Reference

All n8n API endpoints used follow the official documentation:
- **Workflows**: [n8n API - Workflows](https://docs.n8n.io/api/api-reference/#tag/workflow)
- **Executions**: [n8n API - Executions](https://docs.n8n.io/api/api-reference/#tag/execution)

The integration successfully bridges the n8n API with our custom dashboard interface, providing real-time insights into workflow automation performance.
