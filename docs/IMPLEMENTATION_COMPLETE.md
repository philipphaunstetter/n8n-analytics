# Multi-Instance n8n Support - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## üéâ Feature Complete!

All planned functionality for multi-instance n8n support has been implemented and is ready for deployment.

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

### 1. Backend Infrastructure (100%)

  - Connection testing with 10s timeout
  - Status tracking (healthy, warning, error, unknown)
  - User-scoped providers

- ‚úÖ **Provider API Routes** (`src/app/api/providers/`)
  - `GET /api/providers` - List all providers
  - `POST /api/providers` - Create new provider
  - `GET /api/providers/[id]` - Get specific provider
  - `PUT /api/providers/[id]` - Update provider

## üîí Security Features

- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All API keys encrypted at rest
- **Environment-based Key**: Encryption key from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var
- **Server-side Only**: API keys never sent to browser
- **User Isolation**: Each user sees only their providers
- **Connection Testing**: Validates before saving
- **Secure Deletion**: Foreign keys cascade properly

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Optional: Set custom encryption key (recommended for production)
export ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-secure-random-32-char-key"

# If not set, a default key will be used (less secure)
```

### 2. Deploy Code
```bash
# Build and deploy your code
npm run build
# or your deployment process
```

### 3. Migration (Automatic)
The migration runs automatically on first request after deployment:
- Detects existing `integrations.n8n.url` and `integrations.n8n.api_key`
- Creates "Default n8n" provider
- Updates all workflows and executions
- Sets migration flag to prevent re-running

### 4. Manual Migration (Optional)
If needed, trigger migration manually:
```bash
POST /api/admin/migrate-providers
```

### 5. Verification
1. Login to application
2. Go to "n8n Instances" in sidebar
3. Should see migrated provider (if you had existing config)
4. Test connection
5. Add additional providers as needed

## üìù Usage Guide

### For New Users
1. Login/Signup
2. Click "n8n Instances" in sidebar
3. Click "Add Instance"
4. Enter:
   - Name (e.g., "Production n8n", "Dev Server")
   - URL (e.g., "https://n8n.company.com")
   - API Key (from n8n settings)
5. Click "Add Instance"
6. Connection is tested automatically
7. Instance appears in list with status badge

### For Existing Users
1. Login after deployment
2. Migration runs automatically
3. See "Default n8n" provider created
