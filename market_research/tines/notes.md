# Tines â€” Market Research Notes

## Scope
Observability/monitoring features to benchmark: run timelines, case views, error surfaces.

## Key Findings from Security Automation Context

### Platform Positioning
- **Focus**: Security Operations Center (SOC) automation
- **Target**: Security analysts, incident responders, SOC teams
- **Philosophy**: "Stories" (workflows) that automate security processes
- **Emphasis**: Audit trails, compliance, and incident investigation

### Observability Through Security Lens
- **Story Execution Tracking**:
  - Detailed audit trails for every action
  - Timeline-based execution views
  - Evidence collection and preservation
  - Chain of custody for security events

- **Case Management Integration**:
  - Incident-centric workflow aggregation
  - Cross-story correlation and linking
  - Evidence gathering and documentation
  - Investigation timeline reconstruction

- **Compliance & Audit Features**:
  - Immutable execution logs
  - Detailed action attribution
  - Regulatory compliance reporting
  - Forensic analysis capabilities

### Security-First UX Patterns
- **Timeline Visualization**: Chronological view of all actions
- **Evidence Chain**: Clear linking between related executions
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all system interactions
- **Investigation Mode**: Deep-dive analysis tools for post-incident review

## UI/UX Patterns (Security Operations)
- **Timeline-Centric Design**: Events displayed chronologically
- **Evidence Linking**: Visual connections between related items
- **Detailed Context**: Rich metadata for every action
- **Forensic Tools**: Search, filter, and correlation capabilities
- **Compliance Views**: Reports and exports for audit purposes

## Relevance for Our PRD
