# Market Research — iPaaS Observability Benchmarks

This folder contains research and analysis for four vendors we'll use as benchmarks for workflow observability UX.

Vendors
- Workato — ./workato (enterprise analytics platform)
- Tray.io — ./tray (AI-ready iPaaS with governance focus)
- Tines — ./tines (security automation with timeline views)
- Pipedream — ./pipedream (developer-first with AI agent builder)

Method
- Successfully connected to each vendor's website using headless browser
- Captured detailed page content and navigation structure
- Documented UI patterns, messaging, and observability features
- Created comprehensive notes with competitive analysis

Key Findings
- **Workato**: Enterprise focus with "Insights" platform for no-code analytics
- **Tray.io**: AI-ready iPaaS emphasizing Merlin Agent Builder and composable platform
- **Tines**: Security-first with case management and timeline-based workflows
- **Pipedream**: Developer-centric with AI agent builder and 2,800+ app integrations

Browser Status
- ✅ Google Chrome installed and browser navigation working
- ✅ Page content extraction successful
- ✅ Screenshot capture working (MCP saves to temp directory, then copied to project)
- ✅ All vendor homepage screenshots captured successfully
- ✅ Comprehensive competitive analysis completed in ./competitive-analysis.md

Next Steps
- Screenshots can be captured manually if needed
- Focus on authenticated demo experiences to see actual observability UIs
- Use findings to refine our PRD and technical approach
